## Hi, I am a software maker
> involved in researching new technologies and techniques to improve software development processes and their outcomes

I'm a Senior Software Engineer working in Brazil developing microservices, spreading the culture of using microfrontends, customizing pipelines, all this in the cloud native approach. I build lots of projects for fun with GoLang, Javascript and more. A big fan of CI/CD, microservices, clean code, static website generators and the cloud (AWS).

### Projects ðŸ’¼

I like to make quickstarts which can be used as templates to make websites, such as with React, Rest API in Go/NodeJS. See my [quickstart](https://github.com/vivaldomp?tab=repositories&q=quickstart&type=&language=) projects on GitHub.

My gists are available on a one-page site - [Gist Viewer](https://vivaldomp.github.io/gist-viewer/)


### What is this README profile thing? ðŸ¤”

This page you are reading is a profile readme. Around July 2020, GitHub made this a public feature.

To make one, create a repo named after your username (matching case exactly) and create a `README.md` file in it. Then go to your GitHub profile and you'll see your README appear there âœ¨.
